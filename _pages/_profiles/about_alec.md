I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UMass-Amherst. My group focuses on using computation and theory to model, control, and analyze a variety of fluid flows. I am particularly interested in systems that exhibit sustained chaotic dynamics, and the transition mechanisms to chaos. Wall-bounded Newtonian turbulence is a canonical example of a chaotic fluid system, but many other fluid systems can exhibit chaotic behavior, such as bacteria aggregation, viscoelastic flows, and Rayleigh–Bénard convection.
